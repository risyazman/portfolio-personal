<h5>For this 22 years, I through so many hardships in my life. But, I will never give up because i thought all of these are my inspirit for me to move forward. If I felt down, I will remember what my friend said "we just live once, so do whatever we love and don't ever care about people. Leave toxic people". From that day, I will do whatever I love, let people say about you as long as you not hurt them. People loves to talk without know nothing, they often listens but never care. As human, we must remind ourself that just us can build ourselves and not people!</h5>
